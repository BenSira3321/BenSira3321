- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenSira3321
- 👀 I’m interested in application layer 7 security against physical tampering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my enemies respawn like Agent Smith foul spirits.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using the greatest software ever built
- 📫 How to reach me ... that's tough isn't it you could GOTO < 👀 I’m interested in application - security > teaching me is an application isn't it? You could try Facebook or what's app and if I really need to fight against the smart stuff on my phone GnuPG email. No physical postmates (penpals) is not an option the federal US conspired to commit felony larsony with open confession of it - So much for a confederated construct of service "The Pony Express". I could post my Gmail but you see it has this new undo after sent button.
